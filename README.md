# Solana Quest Arena

15-day advent-style quest game inspired by GiftFest mechanics.

**Core loop (MVP):**
- 3×4 grid merge game (spawn using Energy)
- Merge 2 identical items → higher tier
- Legendary merges → badges + XP
- XP leaderboard (verifiable)
- Advent calendar (15 days): energy + items + memes (share to X)

> Note: “shitcoins” in this game are **in‑game points**, not real SPL tokens.
